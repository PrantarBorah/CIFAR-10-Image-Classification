# CIFAR-10-Image-Classification

1) Data Insights and Exploration:

Familiarize with the CIFAR-10 dataset from Keras.
Visually inspect sample images from various classes to understand data distribution
2) Comprehensive Data Preprocessing:

Normalize pixel values of the images to enhance model training efficiency.
Convert image labels into a one-hot encoded format suitable for classification tasks.
Implement data augmentation techniques to increase the dataset's variability and improve model generalization.
3) Architectural Design using Keras:

Design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) tailored for the CIFAR-10 dataset using the Keras framework.
Incorporate mechanisms such as dropouts and regularizations to counteract overfitting.
4) Model Training Process:

Train the CNN using the prepared dataset.
Utilize callbacks to adjust the learning rate dynamically and halt the training early if no improvements are detected, restoring the best model weights from the training.
5) Learning Analysis:

Visualize the model's learning curves, observing both training and validation performance metrics over epochs.
6) Model Evaluation:

Assess the trained model's accuracy and loss on the unseen test data to determine its robustness.
